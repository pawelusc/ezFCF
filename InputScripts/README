This folder contains samples of all formats supported by the 
"make_xml.py" script, which creates an input XML file for 
the 'ezSpectrum 3.0' program.

Script requires a set of ab initio outputs with frequency jobs in
the optimized geometries. First file in the argument's list is
the initial state, others are the target states.

From each file this script copies a geometry, frequencies and
normal modes into the XML file.
Default job parameters and energy difference between the electronic
states (IP, EA, etc) should be adjusted as necessary in the created XML file.


All ab initio inputs (*.in) and outputs (*.out) in this folder contain 
the same frequency job, H2O molecule at HF/6-311G** level of theory:

h2o_qchem.*        Q-Chem 
h2o_aces_new.*     ACESII 2.5.0 version
h2o_aces_old.*     ACESII 0.3 version
h2o_molpro.*       Molpro
h2o_gamess.*       GAMESS (Note: linear molecules are not supported)
h2o_other.out      Gaussian (we can not guarantee it is fully supported, 
                   since we are not allowed to touch it). Use at your own risk!

You can check the script with all supported types by running:

  ../make_xml.py test.xml h2o_qchem.out h2o_molpro.out h2o_aces_old.out \
                     h2o_aces_new.out h2o_gamess.out h2o_other.out


test.xml file will contain ab inito data extracted from the outputs
and will be accepted by ezSpectrum. The produced spectrum will have 
only zero-zero transitions with unit intensities, since all electronic 
states are the same.
